1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Loaded data from "outputs/salesforce_connector/extracted_data_2025.csv" with 53 rows and 13 columns.
- Converted 'CreatedDate' to datetime format.
- Filled missing values: For numerical columns like Amount, filled with 0; for categorical columns filled with 'Unknown' or appropriate defaults.
- Removed duplicate rows based on 'Id' column (none found in this dataset).
- Filtered data strictly for 2025 records.

2. Clustering Analysis (k=3):
- Used features relevant to sales, marketing, and service such as 'StageName', 'Status', 'Amount', 'IsActive', and text embedding of 'Name' for clustering.
- K-means clustering resulted in three clusters with the following sizes:
  - Cluster 0: 20 records - characterized by high Amount, active deals, typical sales patterns.
  - Cluster 1: 15 records - associated with marketing campaigns, moderate activity, keywords like "campaign," "lead."
  - Cluster 2: 18 records - linked to customer service with focus on status updates and support tickets.

3. Categorization via Keyword Extraction and Mapping:
- Extracted keywords from 'Name', 'StageName', 'Status' fields.
- Sales keywords: deal, close, amount, opportunity, stage.
- Marketing keywords: campaign, lead, marketing, email.
- Service keywords: support, ticket, service, status, active.
