**Summary Paragraph of 2025 Insights**  

In 2025, the business landscape is characterized by a maturing sales pipeline with nearly half of opportunities actively progressing through prospecting and qualification stages, and a moderate win rate of 21%, supported by an increasing average deal size toward year-end. Marketing efforts, while active in lead generation via digital channels and test accounts, suffer from a lack of lead engagement, presenting a key area for improvement. Account acquisition shows seasonal patterns, peaking mid-year, which could align with campaign cycles or market demand fluctuations. Internally, strong support is provided by System Administrators and Planners, underscoring the importance of governance and strategic resource allocation. Customer service functions, though not directly measured by ticketing data, are inferred through key roles and notable accounts like 삼성전자, ensuring ongoing client management. The AI-driven segmentation into Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service clusters offers clear direction for targeted interventions—accelerating lead conversion, sustaining sales momentum especially in Q3 and Q4, and maintaining robust customer relations. Overall, 2025 trends indicate a critical need to convert leads more effectively while capitalizing on the expanding sales pipeline and high-value opportunities for sustained growth.
