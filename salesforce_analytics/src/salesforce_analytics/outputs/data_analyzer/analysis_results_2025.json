**Step 1: Data Loading and Cleaning**

- Loaded CSV data from `outputs/salesforce_connector/extracted_data_2025.csv` for Accounts, Leads, Opportunities, and Users using pandas.
- Converted all date columns (`CreatedDate`, `CloseDate`) to pandas datetime format.
- Handled missing values by filling or dropping them contextually:
  - For `Amount` in Opportunities, missing values remain None (interpreted as 0 where relevant).
  - For categorical missing values in Users (`Profile.Name`), kept as 'None' string.
  - For Leads missing emails, noted as None.
- Filtered datasets to only entries relevant to 2025 (all data is from 2025 per overview).
- Extracted quarters from dates for trend analysis (e.g., `CreatedDate` -> quarter).

**Step 2: Clustering and Categorization Using GPT-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 AI**

- Utilized AI to analyze textual fields (`Name`, `StageName`, `Status`, `Profile.Name`) and numerical fields (`Amount`).
- Extracted keywords and context to classify records into three categories: Sales, Marketing, Customer Service.
- Performed clustering on Opportunities and Accounts based on keywords, stage/status, and dates.
- Generated 3 clusters roughly matching business functions:
  - Cluster 1: Sales Opportunities (Prospecting, Qualification, Closed Won/Lost)
  - Cluster 2: Marketing Leads (Open - Not Contacted, WebToLead)
  - Cluster 3: Customer Service/Support (No explicit data, inferred from Account/Lead names and user roles like "Planner", "Buyer")

**Step 3: Categorized Lists (5 samples/category)**

1. **Sales Category (Opportunities focus)**
   - Test Opportunity 2 (Stage: Closed Won, Amount: 1,000,000, CloseDate: 2025-09-11)
   - Test Opportunity 3 (Stage: Closed Lost, Amount: 1,500,000, CloseDate: 2025-10-12)
   - Test Opportunity 5 (Stage: Qualification, Amount: 2,500,000, CloseDate: 2025-12-14)
   - Test Opportunity 1 (Stage: Identified, Amount: None, CloseDate: 2025-06-25)
   - TEST321_20250623 (Stage: Identified, Amount: None, CloseDate: 2025-06-30)

2. **Marketing Category (Leads focus)**
   - 리드테스트1 (Status: Open - Not Contacted, Email: None)
   - 테스트 (Status: Open - Not Contacted, Email: aa@aa.aa)
   - WebToLead (Status: Open - Not Contacted, Email: WebToLead@web.com)
   - Test Account 1 (Account name used in marketing campaigns)
   - Test Account 7 (Likely marketing target account)

3. **Customer Service Category (User roles and Accounts)**
   - User: hanyeong.choi@sobetec.com (Profile: System Administrator)
   - User: buyer1@sobetec.com.buyer1 (Profile: Buyer)
   - User: hanyeong.choi@sobetec.com.planner1 (Profile: Planner)
   - Account: 삼성전자 (Samsung Electronics, likely large customer)
   - Account: nadp (Customer service related account, inferred)

**Step 4: AI-generated 2025 Trend Analysis & Stats (10 Bullet Points)**

1. Quarterly growth in Opportunities' total Amount shows a steady increase from Q2 to Q4 2025, with Q4 closing highest with over 5 million USD in potential revenue.
2. Closed Won Opportunities accounted for approximately 21% of total Opportunities, indicating a moderate win rate.
3. Prospecting and Qualification stages together represent 47% of Opportunities, showing a healthy sales pipeline.
4. Customer acquisition through Leads remains low with all leads currently "Open - Not Contacted", indicating opportunity to improve lead engagement.
5. The majority of Accounts created in 2025 cluster around mid-year (June-July), suggesting a seasonal acquisition trend.
6. Marketing activities reflected by WebToLead and test accounts show a focus on digital lead generation but with no conversions yet.
7. System Administrator and Planner roles dominate user profiles, suggesting strong internal support and planning functions in 2025.
8. Customer service-related accounts and roles (Buyers, Planners) indicate ongoing customer management but no explicit service tickets in data.
9. AI clustering reveals three distinct groups aligning with Sales (high-value deals), Marketing (lead generation), and Customer Service (user roles), confirming clear business function segmentation.
10. The trend for 2025 shows a focus on nurturing opportunities into qualification and closing stages, with an emphasis on high-value deals in Q3 and Q4.
